Performance Warning: Avg frame time 55.2ms | Symbols: 598/600 | Trails: 2341 | Effects: 3
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Collision Detection Algorithm
```python
# Before (Slow)
dist = math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
return dist < collision_dist

# After (Fast)  
collision_dist_sq = collision_dist * collision_dist
dist_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy
return dist_sq < collision_dist_sq
```

### Symbol Pool Caching
```python
# Before (Slow)
symbol_pool = "01„Ç¢„Ç§„Ç¶„Ç®„Ç™..."
symbol = random.choice(symbol_pool)

# After (Fast)
class MatrixSymbol:
    SYMBOL_POOL = "01„Ç¢„Ç§„Ç¶„Ç®„Ç™..."
    SYMBOL_POOL_LEN = len(SYMBOL_POOL)
    
symbol = self.SYMBOL_POOL[random.randrange(self.SYMBOL_POOL_LEN)]
```

### Batch Cleanup Strategy
```python
# Intelligent cleanup based on collection size
if len(self.symbol_trails) > 100:
    # Fast batch cleanup for large collections
    self.symbol_trails = [trail for trail in self.symbol_trails 
                         if trail.is_active(current_time)]
else:
    # Traditional cleanup for small collections
    # (maintains object references better)
```
