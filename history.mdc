**Review:** Initial Project Setup

**Job Card:** 001

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Objective: Construct a live visual ghost display of the task manager's "cpu performance" window.
*   Key Requirements: Always visible (layered between desktop background and active windows), top 10% of display, transparent, live updates.
*   Proposed Stack: Python, psutil, PyQt6/PySide6, pywin32.
*   Initial Plan: Setup -> Data Acquisition -> Basic Window -> Styling/Transparency -> Positioning/Sizing -> Visualization -> Window Layering -> Integration.
*   Initiating project structure and logging.

**Review:** Project File Creation

**Job Card:** 002

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Corrected date/time format in previous log entry (Job Card 001).
*   Created `cpu_overlay.py`.
*   Implemented basic PyQt6 window structure.
*   Added `psutil` for CPU percentage monitoring (updates every second).
*   Configured window for top 10% screen height, borderless, semi-transparent.
*   Included initial `pywin32` code in `showEvent` and `set_window_layer` to make the window click-through (`WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`) and attempt non-topmost layering (`HWND_NOTOPMOST`).
*   Added placeholder label for CPU percentage display.
*   Marked TODOs for graph visualization and advanced desktop layering.

**Review:** Graph Visualization Implementation

**Job Card:** 003

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Acknowledged potential issues with running the overlay GUI within a container (Display access, `pywin32` layering, CPU metrics accuracy, screen dimensions).
*   Added `collections.deque` to store the last 60 CPU percentage readings.
*   Modified `update_cpu_usage` to append the latest reading to the deque.
*   Implemented `paintEvent` method:
    *   Draws a semi-transparent background.
    *   Draws a simple green line graph based on the `cpu_history` deque.
    *   Calculates coordinates to scale the graph (0-100%) to the widget dimensions.
    *   Draws the current CPU percentage text in the top-right corner.
*   Commented out the previous `QLabel` used for text display.
*   Noted that advanced `pywin32` layering (`set_window_layer` TODOs) is unlikely to function correctly within a container.

**Review:** Startup Configuration and Cyberpunk Theme

**Job Card:** 004

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Provided instructions for setting up the script to run on Windows startup using a batch file shortcut in the `shell:startup` folder.
*   Modified `cpu_overlay.py` for a "cyberpunk" theme:
    *   Changed background to darker, less transparent purple/blue (`rgba(10, 10, 25, 200)`).
    *   Added a faint grid overlay in `paintEvent`.
    *   Changed CPU graph line color to neon cyan and increased thickness.
    *   Adjusted text color to light lavender, increased size, made bold, and repositioned (bottom-right example).
*   Imported `QBrush` (though not explicitly used in this revision, added for potential future fill effects).

**Review:** Cascading Purple Visualization

**Job Card:** 005

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Modified `paintEvent` in `cpu_overlay.py` to replace the single line graph with a cascading effect.
*   Implemented a loop drawing multiple (`num_cascade_lines`) historical CPU traces.
*   Each trace is drawn with decreasing opacity (`alpha`) and slightly adjusted color/thickness for older data points, creating a fading trail.
*   Shifted color palette to purples:
    *   Used `QColor.fromHsl` with a base purple hue for cascade lines.
    *   Adjusted grid color to a faint purple.
    *   Changed text color to light lavender.
*   Refined history indexing logic within the drawing loop to handle deque states correctly.
*   Imported `QLinearGradient` (currently unused, but potentially useful for smoother color transitions later).

**Review:** "Mountain Track" Visualization (Filled Area)

**Job Card:** 006

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Replaced the cascading line effect with a filled area visualization in `paintEvent`.
*   Constructed a single `QPainterPath` that encloses the area under the CPU history graph line, extending down to the bottom edge of the widget.
*   Defined a `QLinearGradient` with purple shades (brighter/opaque top to darker/transparent bottom).
*   Used `painter.fillPath()` to fill the constructed path with the gradient, creating a solid "mountain" shape.
*   Added code to draw the top edge line ("ridge") separately with a distinct pen after filling for better definition.
*   Removed the previous multi-line cascade loop.

## Log Entry - 2025-04-30 13:15:00

**Review:** Particle System Visualization (Matrix/Arcane/Cyberpunk Blend)

**Job Card:** 007

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Replaced graph/mountain visualization with a particle system in `paintEvent`.
*   Added a `Particle` class to manage individual particle state (position, speed, color, size).
*   Initialized particle system in `__init__` with a list of particles and defined colors (purple, cyan, green, pink).
*   Separated timers: CPU update @ 1Hz, particle animation @ ~33Hz.
*   Implemented `update_particles`: moves particles down, resets off-screen particles, adds new particles based on CPU load probability.
*   Modified `paintEvent` to draw particles as ellipses with optional faint trails. Kept faint grid.
*   Removed previous graph/fill/cascade drawing code.
*   Adjusted text display (integer %, centered bottom).
*   Ensured HWND is retrieved before attempting layer setting in `showEvent`.

**Review:** Startup Batch File Creation

**Job Card:** 009

**Suggestion/Action:**
*   Created `run_cpu_overlay.bat` in the project directory.
*   Batch file contains commands (`@echo off`, `start "" python cpu_overlay.py`, `exit`) to silently launch the Python script.
*   User needs to manually create a shortcut to this `.bat` file and place the shortcut in the Windows Startup folder (`shell:startup`) to enable auto-start on login.
